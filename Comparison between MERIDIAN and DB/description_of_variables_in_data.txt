b1: bin locations at L1, t1
b2: bin locations at L1, steady state
b3: bin locations at L2, t1
b4: bin locations at L2, steady state
%
m1, m2, m3, m4 are corresponding mean bin fractions
s1, s2, s3, s4 are the standard errors in those means (calculated from 5 repeats).

kdeg and kdegs are 50000 correlated exponentially distributed rates

dtx are 50000 "single cell" data points. The data is divided in 5 experiments to compute the means (m1, ..) and standard errors (s1, ...)
